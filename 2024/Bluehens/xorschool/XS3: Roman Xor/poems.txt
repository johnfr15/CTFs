Compared to the diversity of some of the later poets, 
one may think that William Shakespeareâ€™s poems are a bit lacking in their subject scope. However, 
one would do well to consider the time era from whence these poems were written. During this era, 
literary professionals were hard pressed to make a living. 
Plays (for which William Shakespeare is best known) were looked upon more as a 
hobby than a professional career and so the money for such works was not substantial to live off of. 
Poems were considered to be something for the nobles and upper society. 
Being that parchment was also considered to be a sacred material at that time (mainly due to the scarcity to secure large quantities at one time), 
the lines of the poems written had to be catered specifically to sell. 
What better to sell than a love sonnet during the Elizabethan Era?
