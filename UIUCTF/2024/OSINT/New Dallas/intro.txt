Super wide roads with trains... Is this the new Dallas? Flag format: uiuctf{coordinates of intersection between the rail and the road} Example: uiuctf{41.847, -87.626}

Flag format clarification: Use three decimal points of precision, truncate, and do not round. Use Google Maps location for reference. The last digit of the first cooordinate is odd, and the last digit of the second coordinate is even.
